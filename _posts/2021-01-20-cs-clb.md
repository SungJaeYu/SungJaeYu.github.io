## Compiler

First computer is pragrammed by maching language, But Maching Language is so difficult for human to understand
So, they made some method

- Made text document that express set of machine language
- Made program that change text document to machine language

This program is **Compiler**, and the text document is **source code file, source file**

## Linker

Growing source code size big, they knew writing source code on one file is uncomfortable
they came up with a method divide source code into multi files
but this method needs to link multiple source files
So, they made **Linker** to link source files

## Builder

Steps of making excutable file is

- Write source code
- Compile source code files
- Link object files that compiler made
- Excutable File is created

this steps is **Build**, and program to build is **Builder**

**Compile + Link = Build  
Compiler + Linker = Builder**
