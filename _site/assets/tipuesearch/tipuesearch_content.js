    "text": "Precision &amp; Recall Precision In a classification task, the Precision for a class is the number of true positives divided by the total number of elements labelled as belonging to the positive class Recall Recall is defined as the number of true positives divided by the total number of elements that actually belong to the positive class Precision-Recall Trade-off In an ideal scenario is both precision and recall can get maximum value 1.0 But in most of practical situations, there is noise in the dataset and the dataset is not perfectly separable. Accuracy Precision and recall use only True situation, But we can think about false Accuracy uses False situation Accuracy is an evaluation metric that can most intuitively represent the performance of the model. However, there is something to consider. Bias of domain Therefore, we need a metric to supplement this. F1 Score F1 score is the harmonic mean of Precision and Recall. When the data label is unbalanced, F1 score can evaluate with just one number.",
